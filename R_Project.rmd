## **Introduction:**

- Fencing competitions generate a wealth of data that captures the performance of every fencers from different clubs.  

- This project aims to create a tool that can organize, process and manipulate competition data to generate a performance report of individual fencers and fencing clubs.

## **Key Features:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Alphanumeric characters, such as '3T', are replaced with numeric values, facilitating subsequent computations.
  
- **Club Standardization:** Clubs with multiple names are standardized by taking only the first value. This step ensures consistency in the analysis.
  
- **Whitespace Removal:** Extra white spaces are trimmed from the right of club names to prevent duplicate grouping caused by inconsistent spacing.

- **Dynamic Datatable and Visualization** With data table and interactive visualisations, users can interactively compare fencers' average performances across different clubs.

## **The Data Set:**

- Fencing competition results are found on an online platform called FencingTimeLive.  

- To streamline the analysis, we first need to address missing values and alphanumeric entries in the "Place" column of the CSV file downloaded from the platform.

## **Loading the libraries:**    
- To facilitate user interaction and data processing, I've opted for the following libraries, empowering the creation of a Shiny app. 

- This app enables users to seamlessly upload competition results, which are then parsed and read into R for effective data wrangling.  

- The culmination is a user-friendly interface presenting data in an easy-to-read datatable and interactive visualizations.  


```{r}
library(shiny)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(DT)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

## **Creating a user-defined function:**
- To address the challenge posed by alphanumeric values under the Place column named "__T" in the fencing competition result dataset, I utilized the $ sign to access the Place Column within the DF data frame.  

- Subsequently, I employed the gsub function to replace non-numeric characters in the values of the Place column with an empty string. This cleansing step ensures that only numeric values remain.    

- Finally, to further enhance the data type, I utilized as.numeric, converting the values to a numeric data type for streamlined computation and summarization of the results.  

```{Creating a user defined function}
replace_and_convert <- function(DF) {
  DF$Place <- gsub("[^0-9.]+", "", DF$Place)
  DF$Place <- as.numeric(DF$Place)
  return(DF)
}
```

## **Creating the data processing feature:**

Using dplyr tools, I was able to create the intended summary for my fencing data processing tool.  

I created a single data manipulation pipeline for organisation,readability and clarity. 

Here is the breakdown of the steps:

- Applied the 'replace_and_convert' function to ensure the "Place" column contains only numeric values  

- Selected relevant columns using select to include only essential columns like "Place", "Name" and "Club_Name" that have values and excluded irrelevant columns like "Divisions" and "License" that has only NA values.  

- Employed string manipulation functions from the stringr package like "str_split" and "str_trim" to extract the first club name from multi-club entries and remove trailing white spaces to ensure consistency and avoid the risk of creating duplicates.  

- Grouped the data by fencing club to set the stage for club-specific summaries  

- Computed key metrics for each club such as total number of participating fencers, average position attained, highest and lowest ranked result and medal tally.  

- Arranged the results in descending order based on the total number of participating fencers from each club.

In summary, this streamlined process provides a comprehensive overview of each fencing club's performance, aiding coaches in identifying trends, improvements, and areas for additional support among their fencers.

```{Data Processing Feature}
  Processed_DF<-DF|>
  replace_and_convert()|>
  select(Place,Name,Club_Name = `Club(s)`)|>
  mutate(Club_Name = str_split(Club_Name, "/", simplify = TRUE)[, 1])|>
  mutate(Club_Name = str_trim(Club_Name, side = "right"))|>
  group_by(Club_Name)|>
  summarise(
    Total_Number=n(), 
    Average_Position=as.integer(mean(Place)), 
    Highest_Ranking=as.integer(min(Place)),
    Highest_Ranked_Fencer=Name[which.min(Place)],
    Lowest_Ranking=as.integer(max(Place)),
    Lowest_Ranked_Fencer=Name[which.max(Place)],
      Gold = sum(Place == 1),
    Silver = sum(Place == 2),
    Bronze = sum(Place == 3),
    Total_Medal_Count= sum(Gold,Silver,Bronze))|>
    arrange(Total_Number)
      return(Processed_DF)
```

## **Creating the shiny app:**

Finally, I decided to integrate all the features created earlier with a shiny app to allow users to easily upload the results and interact with the computed summary.  

Here is the breakdown of the shiny app:  

- In the User Interface (UI), it featured a file input button to allow users to upload the fencing competition results in csv format, downloaded from FencingTimeLive.

- In the Server side, reactive functions, "Tabular_Data" and "Visualisation_Data" was implemented to process the uploaded csv file and the data processing feature was applied for detailed analysis. It selected specific columnns and computed key metrics like average position, final ranking and medal counts based on the specific visualisations outputs.

- This results in an interactive display using Datatables and visualizations powered by the plotly and DT packages. The Datatable displays essential metrics, including total fencers, average position, highest and lowest ranks, and medal counts. Visualizations, like the scatterplot for individual performances and the horizontal bar chart for average club performances.  

- This streamlined approach offers fencing coaches a comprehensive overview, enabling them to identify patterns, improvements, and areas of focus among their fencers effectively.  

```{r}
# User defined function
replace_and_convert <- function(DF) {
  DF$Place <- gsub("[^0-9.]+", "", DF$Place)
  DF$Place <- as.numeric(DF$Place)
  return(DF)
}

# UI
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Fencing Data Processing App"),
  fileInput("file", "Choose CSV File"),
  DTOutput("summaryTable"),
  plotlyOutput("scatterplot"),
  plotlyOutput("plot")
)

# Server
server <- function(input, output) {
## Reactive function to read and process and read the uploaded csv file.
 Tabular_Data <- reactive({
    req(input$file)
    DF <- read_csv(input$file$datapath)
    
## Data Processing Feature
  Processed_DF<-DF|>
  replace_and_convert()|>
  select(Place,Name,Club_Name = `Club(s)`)|>
  mutate(Club_Name = str_split(Club_Name, "/", simplify = TRUE)[, 1])|>
  mutate(Club_Name = str_trim(Club_Name, side = "right"))|>
  group_by(Club_Name)|>
  summarise(
    Total_Number=n(), 
    Average_Position=as.integer(mean(Place)), 
    Highest_Ranking=as.integer(min(Place)),
    Highest_Ranked_Fencer=Name[which.min(Place)],
    Lowest_Ranking=as.integer(max(Place)),
    Lowest_Ranked_Fencer=Name[which.max(Place)],
      Gold = sum(Place == 1),
    Silver = sum(Place == 2),
    Bronze = sum(Place == 3),
    Total_Medal_Count= sum(Gold,Silver,Bronze))|>
    arrange(Total_Number)

      return(Processed_DF)
  
  })
## Separate data processing to compute other visualizations
Visualisation_Data <- reactive({
    req(input$file)
    DF <- read_csv(input$file$datapath)
    
## Visualized data for the performance of all fencers
  Visualised_DF<-DF|>
  replace_and_convert()|>
  select(Place,Name,Club_Name = `Club(s)`)|>
  mutate(Club_Name = str_split(Club_Name, "/", simplify = TRUE)[, 1])|>
  mutate(Club_Name = str_trim(Club_Name, side = "right"))|>
  group_by(Club_Name)
  
  return(Visualised_DF)
  })
## Display the individual performances of each fencers organised by clubs.
output$scatterplot <- renderPlotly({
  data <- Visualisation_Data()

 scatter_data <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Place, y = Club_Name, color = as.factor(Place), text = paste("Name:", Name, "<br>Club:", Club_Name, "<br>Final Ranking:", Place))) +
    geom_point(size=3,position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)) +
    labs(title = "Performance of all fencers", x = "Final Ranking", y = "Club Name", color = "Final Ranking") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 6) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("1" = "#fee101", "2" = "#d7d7d7", "3" = "#a77044", "darkgrey")) + 
    theme(legend.position = "none") 
  
  ggplotly(scatter_data, tooltip="text")
})

## Display the processed data in a table
  output$summaryTable <- renderDT({
    Tabular_Data()
  })
  
output$plot <- renderPlotly({
  data <- Tabular_Data()|>
    mutate(Club_Name = reorder(Club_Name, Average_Position))

  bar_data <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Club_Name, y = Average_Position, fill = Average_Position,text = paste("Club Name:",Club_Name,"<br>Average Position:",Average_Position))) +
    geom_col() +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "#66c2a5", high = "#fc8d62", name = "Average Position") +
    labs(title = "Fencer Statistics by Club", x = "Club Name", y = "Average Position", fill = "Average Position") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 6) +
    coord_flip() 

  ggplotly(bar_data, tooltip = "text")
})

  
}

## **Conclusion:**
In developing this simple fencing data processing tool, I managed to apply the various R packages that I was taught in my DSA 212 Data Science with R class.  

These packages were instrumental in streamlining the data analysis workflow:  

- **The shiny package** enabled the creation of an interactive web app, simplifying the upload and processing of fencing competition data in CSV format.    

- **The ReadR package** facilitated seamless integration of external datasets, efficiently reading and parsing CSV files.    

- **The Dplyr package** was crucial for data manipulation and processing, providing essential tools for generating the project's focal point – the interactive report display.  
- **The stringR package** played a pivotal role in standardizing club names, preventing duplicates through string split and trim.     

- **The RColorBrewer package** allowed me to color code data points to improve the intuitive understanding of my visualisations. 

- **The ggplot2, plotly and DT package** empowered the creation of dynamic visualizations and an interactive data table for easy viewing.  

Collectively, these skills resulted in a user-friendly tool automating data cleaning and analysis of fencing competitions, offering coaches and fencers a streamlined way to track performance across competitions.
